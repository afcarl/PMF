# Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
Decompose a (sparse) user-item matrix to lower-rank matrices with f latent features. Includes naive user and item bias and regularization to limit overfitting. Constants remain untuned.

Model trained with stochastic gradient descent. Alternating least squares method pending.
